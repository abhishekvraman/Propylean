# production_plant_model

## Objective
The objective of the project is to create a python library which will help engineers simulate production plants focusing on chemical and related process industries. 
By coupling this library with available data analysis/machine learning frameworks, engineers will be able to enhace operations of their plants.

Futher documentation will be created on how to utilize this library as project takes shape.
